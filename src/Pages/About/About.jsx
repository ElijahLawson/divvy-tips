                <p>Divvy Tips is a mobile-focused responsive web application that looks at
alleviating the pain and time-consuming task of having to calculate the hours, credit card and cash tips, and bar back cut for bartenders that
are “running” the money at the end of the night. It allows bartenders to
log in, submit their hours, and submit their credit card tips for their
respective drawer. This information is stored so, whoever is running the
money, will be able to press a couple buttons and receive a detailed
quick divvy table. This application can save up to three hours,
depending on the bar size, at the end of a long bartending shift.</p>
